    "Looking at the school summary charts, the all charter schools out performed each district school. Looking specifically at Overall Passing Rate, the lowest performing charter school had a 94.38% passing rate versus the highest performing district school had a 74.31% passing rate.  When compared agains the district summary numbers, the charter schools are performing well above average in both math and reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the \"By Grade\" scores, there is little difference (maybe 1.5-2%) between the average scores at each grade level within each individual school.  This may suggest, where scores are low across all grade levels, that certain schools may need to re-evaluate their entire curriculum as their may be systemtic issue in how these courses are currently being taught. \n",
    "\n",
    "More analysis would be warranted to confirm this theory but it appears that students attending small and medium size schools, that spend less than $611 per student, will have a very high chance, approx 93 percent, of passing.  Both small and medium size schools had an average passing rate that met or exceeding a 93 percent overall passing rate.  Schools spending less that $611 per student also realized an average passing rate at approximately 93%.\n",
